# AVL-Trees
AVL class

AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree where 
the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. 

Height balance property uses Right and Left rotations algorithm to rebalance the tree when a node is inserted or removed. 
Minimizing binary tree height yields fastest searches, insertions, and removals.

There are 4 cases for AVL tree rotation:

Case I:  Single rotation.

Case II:

Case  III:

Case IV:
